    "This document contains the Initial Exploratory Data Analysis carried out by [JNCTION](https://jnction.uk/) on behalf of [Trenitalia c2c Limited T/A c2c](https://www.c2c-online.co.uk/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "_______________\n",
    "\n",
    "c2c required initial insights regarding some key aspects of their business, including:\n",
    "- Data Outages and Strikes\n",
    "- Active Trains Over Time\n",
    "- Key Route: Pitsea - Benfleet\n",
    "\n",
    "Which can be found in the following pages of this document.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "JNCTION have also suggested some future work based on this analysis which we believe will assist in optimising resource allocation and providing a better customer experience.\n",

    "The provided csv file **train_timings_data.csv** contains 4 months of data (125 days) between April 1 2022 and July 31 2022 for trains running in the area east of London.  \n",
    "It contains a total of 2,520,092 records.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns included in the file are as follows:\n",
    "- **origin_date**: the date the record was issued\n",
    "- **train_id**: the train identification number\n",
    "- **signal**: the railway signal identification number\n",
    "- **signal_passing_time**: the time the railway signal was passed\n",
    "\n",
    "- **planned_event_type**: this field is populated if the record corresponds to a departure or arrival from a station (or arrival at destination)\n",
    "- **planned_event_location**: the location of the event in the form of a STANOX code is recorded (if the record corresponds to a planned event)\n",
    "- **planned_event_time**: the intended time for the passing of the railway signal (if the record corresponds to a planned event)\n",
    "- **actual_event_time**: the actual time the passing of the railway signal occured (if the record corresponds to a planned event)\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:  \n",
    "Each row represents a record of a train passing a railway signal, with some rows containing information relating to a planned event (departure or arrival from a station).\n",
